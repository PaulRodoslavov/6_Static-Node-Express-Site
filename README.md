In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page where I had a chance to share my contact info and talk a little about  myself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least my five projects.

I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I used Pug templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I used Node.js and Express to:

   Import the required dependencies
   Link the JSON with the Pug templates
   Set up routes to handle requests
   Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
   Handle errors
   Set up a server to serve the project







added transitions by hovering cards of projects
changed font color for title of projects
changed font for h1-h5 on page
